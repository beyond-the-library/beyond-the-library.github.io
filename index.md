## Project Goal

Beyond the Library is a web application for students to post and rate study spots throughout the UH Manoa campus and the surrounding areas so that other students become aware of possible study spots. This is to inform UH students that there are other locations beside the library to study (hence the name). Each entry will list hours, capabilities, capacity of the location, and accessibility to different types of students. In addition, there is a “real-time” feature, where students can login and provide time-stamped notifications about the current state of the study space.

## Team Goals

These are the goals set forth by the team to improve skills in regards to software engineering.

### Soft Skills

* Working together in a team

### Technical Skills

Become better aquatinted with:

* Database (MongoDB)
* Background processing
* Semantic  UI & React
* Galaxy (deployment of a full website)

## Final System Goals

The final version of Beyond the Library should be able to fulfill the following:

* Landing page for users not signed in or signed up. Provides links to guides that show how to sign up and navigate the site.
* User profile page where a user can customize his or her personal information, change password, and delete account.
* Sign up page where non-registered users can create an account.
* Sign in page where registered users can log into their account.
* Add study spot page where users can suggest adding a new study location not presently listed in Beyond the Library. Admin will be responsible for approving and adding the location on the admin version of the page.
* Discover new study spots page where users can find new places to study by filtering locations by indoors/outdoors, times open, on/off campus, etc.

## User Guide

Examples of pages in the Beyond the Library web application.

### Landing Page

![](images/landingpagemockup.png)

The landing page is created with the idea that users shouldn't have to scroll around a page to figure out what the page/website is all about. We provide information about the site and how/why users should create an account. 

### User Profile Page

The User Profile page is meant to highlight the users favorited spots and allows an easy way to customize their account.
