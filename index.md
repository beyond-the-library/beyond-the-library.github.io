## Overview

Beyond the Library is a web application for students to post and rate study spots throughout the UH Manoa campus and the surrounding areas so that other students become aware of possible study spots. This is to inform UH students that there are other locations beside the library to study (hence the name). Each entry will list hours, capabilities, capacity of the location, and accessibility to different types of students. In addition, there is a “real-time” feature, where students can login and provide time-stamped notifications about the current state of the study space.
