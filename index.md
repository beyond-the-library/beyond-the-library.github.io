## Overview

Currently, there is no dedicated website for study spots for UH students! Well that was the case until now. Beyond the
 Library is a web application for UH students to discover and share study spots both on the UH campus grounds and the
  surrounding areas. This is to encourage UH students to go **beyond the library** when it comes to sitting down and
   studying (hence the name). 
  
### Special Sauce

The "special sauce" of Beyond the Library is the integration of a map to the study spot cards. This allows user to
 easily determine the location of a study spot as well as other study spots nearby. Users can also share these
  thoughts by posting comments on the study spot cards.

## User Guide

The following are example snapshots of the pages found in Beyond The Library. 
* Pages denoted with **(User)** indicate that you must be logged into an account to view the page. 
* Pages denoted with **(Admin)** indicate that you must be logged into an administrator account to view the page.

### Landing Page

The Landing Page is a simple page the user will first see when they visit the site. The objective of the site is
 stated plainly to "discover new study spots!". We also suggest to the user that they log in or sign up before
  proceeding. If the user is still lost on what to do next, they are encouraged to visit the Frequently Asked Questions
   (FAQ) page in the navigation menu.

### Discover Page

On the Discover Page, the user can filter study spots by certain criteria (i.e. all study spots that are outdoors
) using the dropdown menu options. Pressing the "clear" button will reset the filter and show all study spots
. Below each study spot card are comments posted by logged in users. The image of each card has a clickable link to its location page.

 When the user clicks on one of the study spot cards, a map is brought up with the study spot marked on the map with
  a blue pointer. The study spot card is then placed to the right of the map.

### (User) My Spots Page

The user's submitted study spots are shown here if the user has any. There is also a button that the user presses to
 get to the new study spot submission form. Users who are new to this page will receive a pop up message.

### Map Page

The Map Page displays all the published locations on the map. Clicking on one of the blue location markers will bring
 up the study spot card to the right of the map. Clicking on the study card spot that pops up will take the user to a
  map showing just that location on the map.

### All Spots Page

The admin can view all study spots regardless if it is classified as "published". It is the admin's duty to review
 and manage all study spots on Beyond the Library. There are 4 classifications:
 * "Archived" are study spots that may no longer be accessible or is currently undergoing renovations.
 * "Rejected" are study spots that are missing information or are not legitimate study spots (i.e. user suggest
  middle of Dole St.).
 * "Pending" are study spots awaiting admin review and approval.
 * "Published" are study spots that are approved study spots and visible to all users.

## Community Feedback

### UH Civil Engineering Student (#1)

* The student understood the purpose of the Beyond the Library and enjoyed the design choices.
* There was minor confusion in understanding the "add spot" page. For example, the student did not understand how to
 retrieve the image url. We took this into account by adding a dedicated section of image url retrieval in the FAQ page.
* The student also suggested that the map page show more information than just the name of the study spot. We
 implemented this change with the study spot card popping up to the right-side of the map.
  
### UH Civil Engineering Student (#2)

* The student also understood the purpose of the Beyond the Library and enjoyed the design choices. This student
 particularly enjoyed the stylized font on the landing page.
* Similar to the previous student, there was confusion on the "add spot" page with how to find the image url.

### UH Mechanical Engineering Student (#3)

_Note: This student tested after changes were made based on feedback by UH students #1 and #2._
* The student enjoyed the design of the website.
* The student felt that navigating the site wasn't difficult and did not provide suggestions for improvements.

### UH Student (#4)

_Note: This student tested after changes were made based on feedback by UH students #1 and #2. This student has asked
 to keep their major confidential._
* The student appreciated the inclusion of a FAQ page.
* The student commented that the design of the site could use some more "character". In response, we added some icons
 to the navigation bar, redesigned the logo, and adjusted some spacing between elements on the page.

### UH Student (#5)

_Note: This student tested after changes were made based on feedback by UH students #1 and #2. This student has asked
 to keep their major confidential._
* The student liked the design of the site and commented that it looked "professional".
* Suggested that students should be able to comment on the locations with their thoughts. In turn, we added a
 comments that appear on the study spot card.
* The student also felt overwhelmed by the multiple entry fields required to add a study spot. We in turn simplified
 the "add spot" form.
